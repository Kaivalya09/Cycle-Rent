# Cycle-Rent

- My first very Basic web-development project
- Participated solo due to teammates being strangers and ditching me at the final moment
- Completed using HTML and CSS without using any templates and bootstrap
- Successfully showed most of my project in the presentation and got good comments regarding daring to continue solo in a team hackathon
